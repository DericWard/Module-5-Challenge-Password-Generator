## Assignment 5: Password Generator
### Description:
#### Generate a random password of a user-selected length, based on user-selected character sets.
#### The password must meet the following requirements:
##### Minimum of 10 and maximum of 64 characters.
##### If the user requests a password of less than 10, or more than 64 characters, the application will continue to request the user input a valid value (no less than 10 and no more than 64). 
##### The user is also offered the opportunity to quit generating a password by pressing a Cancel button instead of inputting a number and pressing the OK button.
##### The user must choose from any or all of the following character sets to form the password: 
###### Uppercased English alphabet letters
###### Lowercased English alphabet letters
###### Arabic numerals (numbers) 0 - 9
###### Special characters eg: # ~ @ ! * etc.
##### Should the user not choose any of the above character sets, the character selection process will restart and the user will again be alerted that they must choose at least one character set before commencing to generate the random password.
##### A page (supplied as starter code by the edX team) is used to display the password to the user after the use clicks a button labelled 'Generate Password'.
### Motivation:
#### The motivation for this project was to satisfy assignment 5 of edX's Front End Web Development bootcamp course, working with and gaining experience with:
#### OBJECTS, FUNCTIONS, NESTED FUNCTIONS, RETURNing data from functions, Local and Global SCOPED declarations, RANDOM NUMBER generation and use, and BOOLEAN decision making. 
#### This application makes use of all of these elements.
